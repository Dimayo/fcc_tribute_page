            <h2>Intoduction</h2>
            <p>Steven Paul Jobs was an American business magnate and investor. He was the chairman, chief executive
                officer (CEO), and co-founder of Apple Inc.; chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of
                The Walt Disney Company's board of directors
                following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely
                recognized as a pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple
                co-founder Steve Wozniak.</p>

            <blockquote>
               
                    "When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to
                    live
                    your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family,
                    have
                    fun, save a little money.
                <br>
                    That's a very
                    limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you
                    that
                    you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can
                    influence it, you can build your own things that
                    other people can use."
