                        "When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to
                        live
                        your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family,
                        have
                        fun, save a little money.
                        <br>
                        That's a very
                        limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you
                        that
                        you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you
                        can
                        influence it, you can build your own things that
                        other people can use."
